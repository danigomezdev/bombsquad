2. **Automatic Connection**: The mod briefly connects to each server
3. **Data Collection**: Player rosters and server info are gathered
4. **Friend Detection**: System checks for friends in each server
5. **Interface Update**: All collected data is displayed

## Requirements

- BombSquad version with API 9 support
- Python modding environment setup
- Internet connection for server discovery
- Public server access for friend tracking

## Customization

### Server Limits:
- Adjust how many servers to cycle through
- Balance between comprehensive data and cycling time
- Default limit: 25 servers

### Friend Management:
- Add friends manually by name
- Remove friends as needed
- Automatic online status detection
- Persistent storage between sessions

## Compatibility

- Works with all public BombSquad servers
- Compatible with most other UI and gameplay mods
- Supports both IPv4 and IPv6 connections
- Works in all game modes

## Performance Considerations

- **Server Cycling**: May take 1-3 minutes depending on server limit
- **Network Usage**: Moderate bandwidth during server discovery
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient data storage and management

## Important Notes

- Friend tracking only works for players on public servers with available slots
- Server cycling involves brief connections but doesn't join games
- Some servers may have anti-bot measures that limit cycling
- Friend detection requires the player to be online during cycling
- Manual friend addition requires exact player names

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
- **No servers found**: Check internet connection and try again
- **Friends not detected**: Ensure friends are on public servers during cycling
- **Connection failures**: Some servers may reject automatic connections
- **Performance issues**: Reduce server limit for faster cycling

### Data Management:
- Friend list stored in `python_directory_user/BestFriends.txt`
- Server data is temporary and resets each session
- Configuration persists between game launches
