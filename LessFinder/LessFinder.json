  "content": "A mod that allows you to search for friends and player accounts, making it easy to check your opponents’ profiles before fighting them.\n\n## Features\n- Search for servers  \n- Add friends  \n- Inspect player profiles  \n- Search accounts by V2, ID, and PB  \n- Advanced search (works even with partial or unknown data (still, try to be specific, you will only be able to see a maximum of 200 accounts))\n- Preferences  \n  - Language Support: Spanish, English, Portuguese, Russian, Hindi, Malayalam, Indonesian  \n  - Color themes  \n- View friends who are online  \n  - *Note: You need to search for servers to see where your friends are playing, and whether there is available space on their server*  \n- View player accounts in-game through the party window  \n- Copy player information to the clipboard  \n\n## Acknowledgements and More\n\nThis is the first official mod I’ve released. I took code and feature references from other mods. I also credited the other mods I used as examples in the mod’s credits.\n\nI’m aware that it has several issues, mainly related to dynamically changing colors. I’m open to fixes and suggestions via DM. I hope you enjoy it—and by the way, thanks to <@1229289799857344588>  for making the video about this."
